# Ephemeral Chat - Deployment & Testing Guide

## 🎉 Application Successfully Created!

Your Ephemeral Chat application is now fully functional and running!

## 🌐 Access URLs

- **Frontend (React)**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/api/health

## 🚀 Current Status

✅ **Server**: Running on port 3001 (in-memory storage mode)  
✅ **Client**: Running on port 5173 with Vite dev server  
✅ **WebSocket**: Real-time communication enabled  
✅ **All Features**: Implemented and ready to test  

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### 1. Basic Room Creation & Joining
1. Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
2. Click "Create a New Room"
3. Optionally set message TTL and password
4. Copy the generated room code (e.g., `A4T2B9`)
5. Open a new browser tab/window
6. Enter the room code to join
7. Start chatting in real-time!

### 2. Advanced Features Testing

#### Message TTL (Time-to-Live)
- Create a room with "30 seconds" message TTL
- Send messages and watch them disappear after 30 seconds
- Notice the countdown timer on each message

#### Room Passwords
- Create a room with a password
- Try joining without password (should fail)
- Join with correct password (should succeed)

#### Rate Limiting
- Send messages rapidly to test rate limiting
- Should be limited to ~30 messages per minute

#### Anonymous Users
- Join with different nicknames
- Leave nickname blank for random generation
- See user list and join/leave notifications

## 🔧 Environment Configuration

Current settings in `.env`:
- `PORT=3001` - Server port
- `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379` - Redis connection (optional)
- `ROOM_EXPIRY_MINUTES=10` - Room auto-expiry time
- `MAX_MESSAGES_PER_MINUTE=30` - Rate limiting

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Prerequisites for Production
1. **Redis Server** (recommended for TTL and scaling)
2. **Process Manager** (PM2 recommended)
3. **Reverse Proxy** (Nginx recommended)

### Quick Production Setup
```bash
# Install Redis (Windows)
# Download from: https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases

# Install PM2
npm install -g pm2

# Build client
cd client && npm run build

# Start with PM2
pm2 start server/index.js --name ephemeral-chat

# Setup Nginx reverse proxy (optional)
# Point to localhost:3001 for API
# Serve client/dist for static files
```

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
# Start both server and client
npm run dev

# Start server only
npm run server

# Start client only
npm run client

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: Change PORT in .env if 3001 is taken
2. **Redis warnings**: Normal if Redis not installed (uses in-memory)
3. **CORS errors**: Check server CORS configuration
4. **WebSocket issues**: Ensure both server and client are running

### Logs
- Server logs appear in the terminal running the server
- Client logs appear in browser developer console
- Check Network tab for API calls and WebSocket connections
