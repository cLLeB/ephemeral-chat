# 📱 Ephemeral Chat: Master Your Privacy
Welcome to the official guide for **Ephemeral Chat**. This app is designed for total anonymity and peace of mind. Every message you send is like writing in the sand at low tide—it’s only there until the next wave.

## 🚀 The Basics: Getting In
You don't need an account, an email, or even a real name. Just a portal.

### 1. Creating a Room (The Host)
*   Tap **"Create New Room"** on the home screen.
*   **Pick a Nickname**: This is how others will see you.
*   **Set a Password (Optional)**: If you want a password you can set one.
    > [!TIP]
    > **Stealth Entry**: When typing your password, you won't see dots or characters. This is a security feature to prevent anyone looking over your shoulder from seeing how many characters your password has!
*   Tap **"Create Room"**.

### 2. Joining a Room (The Guest)
*   **Via Link**: Simply click the link someone sent you. Make sure the link starts with `https://...` and ends with a `#` followed by random characters.

## 🛡️ Your Privacy Tools
We’ve built-in "magic" features to keep your chat truly private.

### 🕵️ Privacy Blur (Instant Protection)

*   **The Magic**: The moment you switch apps or look away from your screen, the entire chat turns into a blurry cloud.

### 👻 The Ghost Watermark
You might notice your name hashed across the background of the chat. This is our **Ghost Watermark**.

## 💬 Mastery of Communication

### 🗣️ Sending Voice Notes
*   Tap and hold the **Microphone (🎤)** icon.
*   Speak naturally. You have **30 seconds**.
*   Release to send, or tap the **Trash (🗑️)** icon to cancel.
*   *Don't worry about compatibility!* Whether you're on an old Android or the latest iPhone, your voice will play perfectly.

### 📞 Starting a Call
Want to talk live? 
*   Tap the **Phone (📞)** icon.
*   The app will automatically use the best connection possible.

### 🎯 Targeted Messaging (Private Talk)
In a room with 10 people but only want to whisper to 2?
1.  Open the **User List** (tap the People icon in the top right).
2.  **Tap the Names** of the people you want to talk to. They will be highlighted.
3.  Go back to the chat. You'll see a blue bar saying **"Sending to X specific users"**.
4.  Send your message. **Only those selected people will see it.** Everyone else gets nothing!
5.  *Tip: Tap "Clear selection" to go back to talking to everyone.*

### 📸 "View Once" Photos
When you share a photo using the **Image (🖼️)** icon, it is sent as a "View Once" message. Once the recipient sees it or closes the room, it's gone forever.
